<b>About This Project</b>

This project is a WIP and is not anywhere near complete. The project will feature a simulated ecosystem with four different organisms. The simulation will show all organisms evolving to a self-sustaining equilibrium. The current code has placeholder names for each organism: Cat, Bird, Rat, and Tree.

Cat:<br>
-Parasitic organism which feeds off the much larger birds. Many cats can feed on a bird at once, though "space" is limited and cats will compete for it.<br>
-Cats reproduce only after death with aid of Rats.<br>
-Cats grow on trees.<br>

Bird:<br>
-Very large organism which hunts and feeds on Rats.<br>
-Birds lose energy when Cats feed on them, but shaking them off requires a large expenditure of energy.<br>
-Able to use Cats as projectile weapons to help hunt Rats, which make the Cat/Bird relationship symbiotic rather than fully parasitic.<br>

Rat:<br>
-Scavenger organism which feeds on Cat Corpses.<br>
-Needs fruit from Trees to reproduce.<br>
-Plants Trees by burying Cat corpses, leading to Cat reproduction.<br>

Tree:<br>
-Planted by Rats from Cat corpses. Requires genes from two Cats to grow.<br>
-The higher fitness of the Cat genes, the more fruit the tree will bear.<br>
-All animals can eat fruit, helping drive competition and making Trees a focal point for interaction.<br>
-Trees grow new Cats.<br>

<b>Current Features</b><br>
Hand-drawn, hand-animated pixel-art sprites<br>
Creatures move toward their fitness payoffs<br>

<b>Pending Features</b><br>
Creatures evolve based on their fitness payoffs<br>
Traits and behaviors based on inherited genes<br>
Creatures evolve and feed off each other, creating a stable and self-sustaining ecosystem<br>
Javascript Front-end so that multiple users can interact with a single simulation running on a server<br>
